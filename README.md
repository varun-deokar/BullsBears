## How to play
- The computer will randomly select a four letter word with unique letters. Your objective is to guess that word in the minimum moves<br>
For each word you guess, the computer will reply with a Bull number and a Bear number. <br><br>
- 1 bull represents a letter in the word you guessed is shared by the computer generated word and occurs at the right position<br>
Eg. If the computer generated the word 'mind' and you guess the word 'mope', the computer will reply with 1 bull <br>
as the letter 'm' is common to both words and is at the right position(first letter in both) <br><br>
- 1 bear represents a letter in the word you guessed is shared by the computer generated word but is at the wrong position <br>
Eg. If the computer generated the word 'mind' and you guess the word 'poem', the computer will reply with 1 bear <br>
as the letter 'm' is common to both words but is at different position <br><br>
- Using analytical skills and ingenious words, find the computer generated word in minimum moves.
